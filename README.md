Following agent app gives out movie recommendations with details like IMDBid, genre, ratings and more included.

Minimal functional features:
    
    1. Agent can give out recommendations,
    2. You can filter out agent's list to specific needs (Genre, rating, year of release).


Broad features (WIP):
    
    1. Length of the movie is considered with respect to user tolerancy when recommending movies.,

    2. Being able to filter out recommendations by genres by selecting GUI buttons,

    3. Being able to reduce scope of recommendations (from 250 to 10 or 5),

    4. Add seperation classics/recent (10 years) to shape recommendations timeline,

    5. Login and have DB for user,

    6. Give recommendations based on user's previously watched list,
Request OMDB API for live details


Future Plans:
    
    1. Changed mindset feature: Movies user did not like very long time ago but considered classics

    2. Not interested genres algorithm: Genres user rated less than N times (TBD later)

    3. Algorithm rating: Average of movies that user watched and recommended by algorithm.
